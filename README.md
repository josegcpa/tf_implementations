# Implementations of deep-learning networks in tensorflow

Tensorflow (tf) implementations of: 

* [U-Net](https://github.com/josegcpa/tf_implementations/blob/master/u-net.py) [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)] 
* [A variational auto-encoder](https://github.com/josegcpa/tf_implementations/blob/master/vae.py) (VAE) [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)]
  * I would also recommend this for a clearer understanding [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908)]
* [A region proposal network](https://github.com/josegcpa/tf_implementations/blob/master/rpn_with_anchors.py) (RPN) [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083)], featuring:
  * Anchors [[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)]
  * A feature pyramid network (FPN) [[6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144)]
    * MobileNetV2 backbone [[7](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)]
    
This is not extremely organised for now;
In the future input examples will be added to this repository to facilitate usage.
